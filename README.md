# Forest Fire Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict forest fire occurrences based on environmental and meteorological factors. Using machine learning techniques, we develop a predictive model to estimate the burned area of forest fires. The dataset contains historical fire records with attributes such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and drought indices. The goal is to enhance early warning systems and improve forest fire management by providing data-driven insights.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- The dataset consists of historical forest fire incidents with features influencing fire behavior.
- Key features include:
   1. X - x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9
   2. Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9
   3. month - month of the year: "jan" to "dec" 
   4. day - day of the week: "mon" to "sun"
   5. FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20
   6. DMC - DMC index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3 
   7. DC - DC index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6 
   8. ISI - ISI index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10
   9. temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30
   10. RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100
   11. wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40 
   12. rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4 
   13. area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84 
   (this output variable is very skewed towards 0.0, thus it may make
    sense to model with the logarithm transform).
